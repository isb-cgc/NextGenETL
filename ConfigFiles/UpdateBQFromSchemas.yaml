  # Where is the repo?
  SCHEMA_REPO_URL: https://github.com/your_schema_repo.git

  # What repo directory holds the schema data files?

  # What project are we in:

  # Where is the BQ table dataset:

  # For each table to update, what is the schema file in the repo:
  FIX_LIST:
    - Your_pre_publication_table_1 : table_info_file.json
    - Your_pre_publication_table_2 : table_info_file_too.json

# Note that although the steps are given in the actual order here as
# a list, changing the order here does not change the order of execution, which is fixed.

steps:

  # Get the table schema/description/tags pulled from git:
  - pull_table_info_from_git

  # Extract the table schema/description/tags from that file:
  - process_git_schemas

  # Update the field descriptions:
  - update_field_descriptions

  # Add table description and tags to table:
  - update_table_description
