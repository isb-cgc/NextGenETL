  # What project is the table in:

    - target_dataset_1.Your_BQ_table_1 : table_info_file.json
    - target_dataset_2.Your_BQ_table_2 : table_info_file_too.json

# Note that although the steps are given in the actual order here as
# a list, changing the order here does not change the order of execution, which is fixed.

  # Extract the table schema/description/tags from that file:
  - process_git_schemas
