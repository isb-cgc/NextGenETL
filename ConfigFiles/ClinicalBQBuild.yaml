steps:

  # Get the manifest from the source data node:
  - retrieve_and_output_cases

  # Output stats and information about clinical dataset from API
  - check_clinical_data

  # Get the table schema/description/tags pulled from git:
  - create_bq_schema_obj

  # Build BQ Table
  - build_bq_table
