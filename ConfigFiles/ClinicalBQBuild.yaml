  # List of 'expand' field groups to include in the clinical data bq table. For example:
  # EXPAND_FIELD_GROUPS: 'demographic,diagnoses,diagnoses.treatments,diagnoses.annotations,'
  # 'exposures, family_histories, follow_ups, follow_ups.molecular_tests'
  # Note -- if a new type of doubly-nested field group is added here,
  # it will be necessary to edit flatten_case_recursive() in build_clinical_data_program_tables.py.
  # Otherwise, the script won't store the doubly-nested group's direct ancestor id.
  # This won't impact how build_clinical_data_bq_table.py (which this yaml configures) runs.
  # (Currently, it will automatically work for child field groups of follow_ups and diagnoses.)
